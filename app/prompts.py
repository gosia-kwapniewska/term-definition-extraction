SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an information extraction system for legal definitions. 
Your task is to identify concepts from legal text that are either:
- defined explicitly in the text, or
- defined by an external reference.

Always return a valid JSON array of extracted concepts. 
If no concepts are found, return: []
"""

USER_PROMPT = """
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. A "concept" is a term that is defined in the text or defined by an external reference. External references themselves are not concepts. 
2. Definitions "in the text" must state what something IS or MEANS. Ignore:
   - statements of duty, permission, or rights ("shall", "must", etc.)
   - descriptions of how something is used or what it does
   - trivial restatements that add no information.
   The definition should be word by word taken from the original text (with exception fo point 7).
3. Definitions "by external reference" include references to outside sources ("as defined in...", "in accordance with...", "prescribed by..."). Ignore circular self-references (e.g., "see section 123").
4. If a concept has alternative terms, include them.
5. If concepts form a hierarchy (one is a more specific case of another), use "subclass_of".
6. If concepts are strongly related but not hierarchical, use "see_also".
7. Combine multiple parts of a definition into one string, separated by "|".

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array. Each object must have the following fields:

{
  "concept": string,
  "defined_by": "text" | "external reference",
  "definition": string,
  "alternative_terms": [string],
  "subclass_of": [string],
  "see_also": [string]
}

If no concepts are found, return: []
